# BASICS OF THE GAME HANGMAN


A man's life is in danger. And you've got his fate in your hand. If you guess the word that Mr. Computer gives you correctly, the man will be saved!

Hang on, there is a 'but' here. You have to guess the word in six tries. Each wrong guess will deduct your number of tries by one. Wait, there's 
another 'but', this one is good for you. Mr. Computer is a kind fellow, he will give you a 'Hint' tool that you can use to help your winning chances.


# RULES OF THE GAME

1. A word is chosen by Computer and you have to guess it. The number of underscores printed will tell you about the length of word.

2. You can only type one letter of the word at a time. If there's more than one occurence of the same letter in a word, you will have to type for
   each letter. 
   Example :- There is a double occurence of 'A' in 'SAUNA'. You will have to type 'A' two times.

3. You will have to guess the word in 6 tries. But don't worry, the tries will not be deducted if you guess a letter correctly! But it will be deducted
   by one each time you guess a wrong letter. As your number of tries will reduce, the picture of the hanged man will complete. Once fully completed,
   the man will be hanged and you will lose the game!

4. Types of input that are valid in the game : All alphabetical letters and the word 'hint'.

5. It doesn't matter if your input is lowercase or uppercase, all kinds of input whether it's lowercase or uppercase or the mix of two is accepted,
   unless and until it is valid.
   Example :- 'a' and 'A' both correspond to the same thing. 'hint' written as 'hiNt' or some other kind is also accepted.

6. To help in your guesses, a Hint tool is provided. It can be activated by typing 'hint'. The Hint tool reveals a letter that has not been guessed
   yet. The tool is only available twice per game, so use it wisely!

   NOTE : When only one letter is remaining to be guessed, the Hint tool can't be activated.


Also,
    Hangman is a fun to play interactive game that is developed to test your wit and your guessing skills. Don't smash your device if you guess a word
    wrong. :)
